This project intends to contribute to fighting the problem of AMR by helping health professionals diagnose
resistance in a particular bacterium more quickly and easily just by analyzing its images from in vitro solid
culture. Thus, it is aimed to develop software using machine learning/deep learning capable of using
images of bacteria from in vitro solid cultures to detect specific features related to resistance antibiotics.

The first step will comprise data pre-processing to prepare the dataset:
• Resize image data.
• Normalize and enhance data through rotation, mirroring, and cropping.

The following tasks will be dedicated to classify species and strains and also classify specific morpholo-
gies using tools such as sklearn, Keras, and PyTorch. Finally, embeddings, models, and architectures will
be model and train.
By pursuing these objectives and tasks, the project aims to empower healthcare professionals with a
tool that efficiently assesses antibiotic resistance in bacteria.
