This project aims to help combat the problem of AMR by helping healthcare professionals to identify a particular bacterium more quickly and easily, simply by analysing its in vitro solid culture images. 
The aim is to develop software using machine learning/deep learning capable of using in vitro solid culture images of bacteria to detect specific characteristics related to antibiotic resistance.

The first step will comprise data pre-processing to prepare the dataset:

• Resize image data.

• Normalize and enhance data through rotation, mirroring, and cropping.

The following tasks will be dedicated to classifying species and strains using tools such as sklearn, Keras and PyTorch. Finally, embeddings, models and architectures will be modelled and trained. 
By pursuing these objectives and tasks, the project aims to empower health professionals with a tool that effectively assesses antibiotic resistance in bacteria.
